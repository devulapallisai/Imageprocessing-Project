Steps to setup code of approach using Gabor filters

1. Create a folder named datasets and in that folder create folder COFOMOD_v2 
2. Download all the images from the link https://www.vcl.fer.hr/comofod/ and extract the zip file into that folder. This is to make sure the paths of project coincide otherwise code will give you error
3. Download opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib packages 
4. L (in the code) = Number of images being tested. (Change this If you want any testing)
5. Make sure the PATH variable in the file is correct with respect to your setup
